  <h1>
    The road to a COVID-free Victoria
  </h1>
  <p>
    <mark><b><a href="COVID.html">←Back to per-country plots</a></b></mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    Victoria is emerging from a fairly strict lockdown, and is aiming to have no local
    spread of the virus. If they succeed, it could mean Australia will be COVID free.
  </p>
  <p>
    How have Victoria's restrictions affected the spread of the virus? Can we expect the
    virus to be eliminated in Victoria? If so, when? The below plot shows how the
    effective reproduction number of the virus, <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has changed over
    time in Victoria, as well as how the daily cases have changed over time, with a
    projection based on the current estimate of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>.
  </p>

    Is Victoria on track to meet its targets for easing restrictions in Melbourne? The
    below plot shows the 14-day average of daily cases, and the targets required to move
    to each step at their earliest possible dates. The requirement to move to the last
    step is zero cases for 14 days, which can't be shown on the plot. The projected
    14-day average is based on the projected case numbers as in the above plot.

  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  These projections are simple extrapolations of what will happen if
  <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> remains at its current value. This does not take into
  account that things may change. As restrictions are lifted, the virus may have
  more opportunities to spread and so <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> may increase. On the
  other hand as case numbers decrease and clusters are better tracked via contact
  tracing, <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> may decrease. Finally, as case numbers get low,
  the random chance of how many people each infected person subsequently infects
  will become more important, and calculating a state-wide average of this (the
  definition of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>) will not be particularly meaningful or
  useful for prediction. As such the projections should be taken with a grain of
  salt—they are merely an indication of the trend as it is right now.
  <h3>Methodology</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      2020-09-23 Data source change: These plots now use DHHS-provided historically
      corrected case numbers, backdated to the date the test was taken, instead of daily
      net case numbers. This means that reclassifications each day now modify historical
      data instead of simply subtracting from the case numbers on the date the
      reclassification was done.
    </li>
    <li>
      2020-09-17 methodology change: The padding of the data is now based on a two-week
      fit instead of a one-week fit. This decreases the sensitivity of the latest estimate
      to day-to-day noise, instead keeping it more in line with longer-term trends. The
      uncertainty calculation has also changed—uncertainty in historical
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> values was previously overestimated and is now calculated
      more accurately.
    </li>
    <li>
      Daily case numbers have been smoothed with 4-day Gaussian smoothing:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i>) = <i>N</i>(<i>t</i>) ∗
      (2<i>πT</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>-1/2</sup> exp(-<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> /
      2<i>T</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>)
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>s</sub> = 4 days
      and ∗ is the convolution operation.
    </li>

    <li>
      Before smoothing, the daily case numbers are padded on the right with an
      extrapolation based on a exponential fit to the most recent fortnight of data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> is then calculated for each day as:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = (<i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) / <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub><i>i</i>-1</sub>))<sup><i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
      where <i>T</i><sub>g</sub> = 5 days is the approximate generation time of the virus.
    </li>
    <li>
      The uncertainty in <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> has contributions from the uncertainty
      in the above-mentioned exponential fit, as well as Poisson uncertainty in daily
      case numbers, and an additional 20% uncertainty in daily case numbers - the latter
      is just a crude eyeballed figure of observed day-to-day fluctuations.
    </li>
    <li>
      The extrapolation of daily case numbers is based on exponential growth/decay using the most recent value of <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub> and its uncertainty range:
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>N</i><sub>extrap</sub>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i>) = <i>N</i><sub>smoothed</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>) <i>R</i><sub>eff</sub>(<i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)
      <sup>(<i>t<sub>i</sub></i> - <i>t</i><sub>today</sub>)/<i>T</i><sub>g</sub></sup>
      <br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
